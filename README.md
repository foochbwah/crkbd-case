you will need:

* plate (the default ones are what I used)
* 10x 7mm M2 standoffs
* 2x other M2 standoffs at whatever height you want your OLED covers
* 24x 5mm M2 screws



Note:

* The .stl file is for **one half** of the keyboard. Flip it in your 3d printer's software for the other half.
* The usb cutout is sized for usb-c and will be a bit big if you are using pro micros
