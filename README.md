# HIGH PROFILE 3D PRINTABLE CRKBD CASE

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foochbwah/crkbd-case/master/IMG_0155.jpg)



You will need:

* Plate (the default ones are what I used)
* 10x 7mm M2 standoffs
* 2x other M2 standoffs at whatever height you want your OLED covers
* 24x 5mm M2 screws



Notes:

* The .stl file is for **one half** of the keyboard. Flip it in your 3d printer's software for the other half.
* The USB cutout is sized for USB-C and will be a bit big if you are using Pro Micros.
* The source file (.3dm) is not cleaned up at all, but it's there if you want to mess around with it.
